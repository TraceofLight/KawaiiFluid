# Interaction BP Example

## Bone Collision Event

## Resistance

![Resistance 1](media/interaction-resistance-1.png)

![Resistance 2](media/interaction-resistance-2.png)

Resistance is for Player Movement. (e.g., slow movement in water, slower movement in Lava because lava has more density).

## Bone Collision Event By Force and Velocity

![Bone Force 2](media/interaction-bone-force-2.png)

![Bone Force 3](media/interaction-bone-force-3.png)

This is an example; Play Montage is not set in this example.

You register monitored bones in the detail panel, and the node returns the monitored bone force.

## Bone Collision Event By Specific Bone and Location

![Bone Location 1](media/interaction-bone-location-1.png)

![Bone Location 2](media/interaction-bone-location-2.png)

This is for events at a specific location, specific bone, and specific local location. You can return a value and trigger events.
